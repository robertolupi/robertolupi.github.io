My name is Roberto Lupi. I am a software and systems engineer.

This site contains my opnions and point of view. It does not reflect my current and past employers.

# SRE at Google

I work at Google as a _site reliability engineer_ (SRE) since 2012.


I focus on hardware, software and infrastructure co-design for next-generation TPU supercomputers. TPUs are Google's own chips for deep learning and artificial intelligence.

I work on Machine Learning hardware platforms, both on internally developed hardware and on commercially available accelerators, such as NVIDIA's.


I have been in several teams responsible for systems such as Borg ([1](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/),[2](https://research.google/pubs/pub44843/),[3](https://research.google/pubs/pub49065/)), Google's large-scale cluster scheduler that inspired Kubernetes, [Monarch](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3181-adams.pdf), the global monitoring system that monitors Google datacenters, and Google's largest internal instance of [Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving?hl=en), a serving system for machine learning models.

# Previously...

From 1998 to 2012, I worked as a software engineer, systems engineer and independent consultant in Italy.

At a point in time, more than 20 banks and several medium-sized companies run software that I wrote.

I have a degree in "*Ingegneria informatica e dell'automazione*", computer science and automation engineering, from [Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche](https://www.univpm.it/).
