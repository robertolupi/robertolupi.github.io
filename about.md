I am a software and systems engineer.

This site contains my opnions and point of view. It does not reflect my current and past employers.

# SRE at Google

I work at Google as a _site reliability engineer_ (SRE) since 2012.


I focus on hardware, software and infrastructure co-design for next-generation TPU supercomputers. [TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) ([ACM in-depth overview](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/7/245702-a-domain-specific-supercomputer-for-training-deep-neural-networks/fulltext)) are Google's own chips for deep learning and artificial intelligence.

I support machine learning platforms, both using internally developed hardware and  commercially available accelerators, such as NVIDIA GPUs.

Many of the recent advancements in artificial intelligence happened on hardware platforms that I manage. [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/) and many other leading AI companies use these systems.


I have been in several teams responsible for systems such as [Borg](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/) ([2](https://research.google/pubs/pub49065/)) the large-scale cluster scheduler that inspired [Kubernetes](https://research.google/pubs/pub44843/), [Monarch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlvJdK1xsl4) monitoring system ([paper](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3181-adams.pdf)), and the largest internal instance of [Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving?hl=en).

# Previously...

From 1998 to 2012, I worked as a software engineer, systems engineer and independent consultant in Italy.

At a point in time, more than 20 banks and several medium-sized companies run software that I wrote.

I have a degree in "*Ingegneria informatica e dell'automazione*", computer science and automation engineering, from [Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche](https://www.univpm.it/).

My full work history is available on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertolupi).
